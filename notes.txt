__________  forEach() vs map()  ______________________________________________________________________________________________________
<<<< !long story short, we can't use the return keyword return with forEach in it, and map does  >>>>                                
                                                                                                                                     
    .map() returns new array of modified elements and forEach just                                                                    
     iterates through array and doesn't return anything.
        we can use forEach to put the items inside an array then outside the forEach return that array somewhere like in a function
          Thats why we use map in return jsx with state not foreach.
            we can use forEach or map with mongoose because we are not rendering, just putting in another array or string.


   
    [1,2,3].map((n)=> n); => returns [1,2,3]




   [1,2,3].forEach((n)=> n); => returns undefined 
    so with forEach we can iterate through an array and push it 
      into another array or string then return that array...
        let list_two = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
        let itemsForEached = [];
        list_two.forEach(num => itemsForEached.push(num * 0))
        log(itemsForEached)// Â [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
